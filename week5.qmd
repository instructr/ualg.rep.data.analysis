### Done in Class

#### **1. Metadata Files**

- **Discussion Topics:**
  - What is a metadata file, and why is it important for reproducibility?
  - **Minimum information to include**:
    - Variable names and descriptions
    - Units of measurement
    - Data types (e.g., numeric, categorical)
    - Valid value ranges
    - Missing value encoding
  - **Encoding not applicable or missing values**:
    - Use standard codes (e.g., `NA`, `null`, or defined codes like `999`), and document them clearly
  - **Categorical variables**:
    - Define all possible levels
    - Include labels or descriptions for each level, if acronym is being used
  - **Best practices**:
    - Keep metadata in a separate, human-readable file (e.g., CSV, TXT)
    - Use consistent naming between metadata and data files
    - Regularly update metadata as data evolves

- **Activity**:
  - Analyze and discuss a **good example** of data and metadata from a Figshare dataset record ([Link here](https://smithsonian.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Dataset_Carbon_stocks_and_environmental_driver_data_for_blue_carbon_ecosystems_along_the_Pacific_coast_of_North_America/28127486)).
  - Look at the paper that analysis the dataset above: ([Link here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GB008239))

#### **2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

- **Discussion Topics:**
  - Can categorical variables be included in PCA?
    - Generally, PCA is for **continuous variables**
    - Categorical variables need to be **encoded numerically** (e.g., one-hot encoding), which may affect interpretation
    - Consider alternative techniques like **Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)** for purely categorical data

- **Resource**:
  - Watch and evaluate **StatQuest video on PCA** ([Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ))

#### **3. Visualizing Distributions of Variables**

- **What to look for in plots**:
  - Outliers
  - Skewness or symmetry
  - Bimodal or multimodal distributions
  - Unexpected patterns or values

- **Questions to ask when selecting plots**:
  - What story does this plot tell? What information does it convey? Is this information what I am aiming to show?
  - Is the plot relevant to the hypothesis or goal of my analysis?
  - Is it easy to interpret by the target audience?
  - Are there simpler visualizations for this variable? "Less is more!"
  - Use previous results/plots/analyses to inform which plots to show next, and keep in the main text versus sending to supplementary material.

- **Data validation through visualization**:
  - Identify data entry errors or inconsistencies
  - Spot missing or unusual values
  - Confirm assumptions (e.g., normality, bimodality...)
  - Help ensure robusteness and reliability
  - Whenever possible, show all data points (Transparency is key for reproducibility)

- **Choose your plots wisely!**

  Useful online galleries of plots, per type of data or information to be displayed:

  - Includes R code for all plots: [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
  - [Visual vocabulary](https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/)
  - [The Do's of chart design](https://chart.guide/design/)
  - [Finantial Times: Chart-Doctor](https://github.com/Financial-Times/chart-doctor/tree/main/visual-vocabulary)

#### **4. Critical Review of Nature Scientific Data Papers**

- **Papers for student-led discussion**:
  - Paper 1: *High-quality genome assembly of the azooxanthellate coral Tubastraea coccinea (Lesson, 1829)*    
  [DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04839-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04839-7)  
  - Paper 2: *Seagrass morphometrics at species level in Moreton Bay, Australia from 2012 to 2013*    
  [DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.60](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.60)

- **Guiding questions for critical review of a data descriptor article**:
  1. Did the authors successfully show the relevance of their data to their scientific community?
  2. Is the data of high quality?
  3. Are all visualizations necessary and informative?
     - Are they easy to interpret?
     - Are they well-described?
  4. Is any crucial information, about the data or the experimental design, missing?
  5. Would you feel confident using this dataset in a new analysis? Why? Why not?


### To Do at Home

1. Experimental Design figure, in vectorial format (pdf, eps, svg).

**Top Tips for an Experimental Design Figure**

  - Keep it **simple and clear**  
  - Show the **workflow or timeline** of the experiment  
  - Include key elements: **groups, treatments, time points, sample sizes**  
  - Use **consistent labels and colors**  
  - Make sure it's **readable and matches the methods**  
  - Export as a **vector (PDF/SVG)** for best quality  


2. Next Week, each student will receive *individual* R code review. Please complete and format your R code, to the best of your current ability. Focus areas for next week's feedback will be:
    - Code **correctness** and clarity
    - **Annotation** and commenting practices
    - Proper use of **literate programming** (e.g., R Markdown)
    - Adherence to **best practices** in reproducible research workflows (Git)
    
Please make notes of any difficulties and questions to guide our discussion next week.
