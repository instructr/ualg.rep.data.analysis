üìñ **Synopsis:** Setting up the computer system for reproducible data analysis  
:::

</br>

#### **Prerequisites | Mandatory**

  - You **should** bring your own laptop. This course teaches essential data analysis skills, including setting up and managing your computing environment. Bringing your own laptop ensures you can apply what you learn, practice continuously, and integrate it into your research.
    - If you do not have one, an RStudio Server account can be created.
  - You must have administrator privileges to install software in your computer;


### How to setup your system for reproducible data analysis {.tabset}

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of reliable data analysis, ensuring that results can be consistently replicated and built upon.

Setting up a system for **reproducible data analysis** requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. Bellow is an overview of the **major steps** a researcher should take into consideration.

### Tools used for this course

In this course, we will use **R** and **RStudio** for data analysis, and **Git** and **GitHub** for version control:

- **R** is a powerful programming language designed for statistical computing and data analysis.  
- **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a user-friendly interface for writing, debugging, and managing R code.  
- **Git** is a version control system that tracks changes in code, allowing for efficient collaboration and history management.  
- **GitHub** is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories, enabling code sharing, collaboration, and version tracking across teams.  

By combining these tools, researchers can streamline their workflows, ensure reproducibility, and foster collaboration and efficiency in data-driven projects.


### Install software

  1. First install R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
  2. Then install RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
  3. Install git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>   
    - Detailed instructions for each Operating System (Linux, Mac, Windows) [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  4. Create an account in GitHub: <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github>
