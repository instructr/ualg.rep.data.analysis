### To Do at Home

Particular tasks for BB

1. **Refactor the data analysis script** by splitting the current single script into two separate scripts: one for *Descriptive Analysis* and one for *Modeling*.

2. **Apply the following changes to the data analysis scripts**:

   * Add the `site` variable to the tidy dataset.
   * Exclude the `id` variable from the MCA calculation.
   * Color the PCA plots using relevant categorical variables to help identify groupings.
   * Move the PCA visualization with variable vectors to the modeling script.
   * Combine the individual histograms into a single multi-panel figure.
   * Remove the printing of descriptive statistics for each variable separately; keep only the summary table with all variables described.

3. **Draft the *Scientific Data* descriptor manuscript**: Prepare a clean first draft to share with the tutor for feedback.

4. **Prepare final questions or suggestions** related to reproducible data analysis for discussion.
